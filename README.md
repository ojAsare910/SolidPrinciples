# Solid Principles
*Solid Principles with Java*

1. Single Responsibility:<br>
Each class should have only one sole purpose, and not 
be filled with excessive functionality
<br></br>

2. Open Closed:<br>
Classes should be open for extension, closed for modification.
<br>In other words, you should not have to rewrite an existing class
for implementing new features.
<br></br>

3. Liskov Substitution: <br>
This means that every subclass or derived class should be substitutable
for their base or parent class.
<br></br>

4. Interface Segregation: <br>
Interfaces should not force classes to implement what they can't do.
Large interfaces should be divided into small ones.
<br></br>

5. Dependency Inversion: <br>
Components should depend on abstractions, not on concretions.
